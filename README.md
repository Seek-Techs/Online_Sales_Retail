# Retail Sales Data Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains the code and data for analyzing retail sales data. The analysis aims to identify discount or promotion events, quantify their impact on revenue, optimize pricing strategies, segment customers, and detect outliers in total price and quantity.

## Project Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- **data_analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis.
- **data/**: Directory containing the datasets used for analysis.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.

## Objectives

The main objectives of the analysis include:

1. Identify discount or promotion events in the sales data.
2. Quantify the quantity purchased during discount or promotion events.
3. Determine the impact of discounts on revenue.
4. Optimize pricing strategies to affect customer buying behavior.
5. Segment customers based on their purchasing behavior.
6. Check for outliers in total price and quantity to understand unusual patterns in sales data.
